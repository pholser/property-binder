                      Property Binder
                      ---------------

    Property Binder is a Java library that provides typed access to entries
    in properties files. It offers such access by allowing a programmer
    to provide it a Java interface whose methods represent the keys
    of the properties file. The methods can be annotated to indicate
    what property the method represents, what default value(s) it should
    assume if the property is not present, and what pattern separates
    the individual values of multi-valued properties.

    The latest major version of Property Binder admits properties files,
    resource bundles, and string-keyed maps out of the box. You can bind
    other types of string-keyed configuration by providing an implementation
    of interface <<<PropertySource>>>.

    Property Binder builds on work described in
    {{{http://lemnik.wordpress.com/2007/03/28/code-at-runtime-in-java-56/}
    this blog post}}. That post, along with a similar technique used on
    the author's work project for eliminating repetitive boilerplate in
    {{{http://spring.io} Spring}}
    {{{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/} JDBC}}
    {{{https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/jdbc/object/StoredProcedure.html}
    stored procedures}}, demonstrate a means of declarative programming
    in Java that seemed unique and powerful and enough to deserve its
    own name: PICA (Proxied Interfaces Configured with Annotations).
    The PICA technique and the beginnings of Property Binder are described
    in {{{http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/42492} this article}}.

    Here are some libraries that perform the same duties as Property Binder:

    I'd love to hear your constructive
    {{{mailto:pholser@alumni.rice.edu} feedback}}, especially suggestions for
    improvements to the library or the site!  If your project is using
    Property Binder, do let me know.
